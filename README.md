Second attempt at making a simple page to showcase some YouTube vids.

Fisrt attempt I struggled to get the spinning earth image in the right position. Decided to start fresh.

Managed to get most of it working.

Earth still needs positioning properly, and I need to figure out how to give it a lower z-index without completely breaking everything.

Rotation animation works well though.
